For the webhooks replace `paste url here` with your webhook URL and ***DO NOT LET ANYONE GRAB YOUR WEBHOOK URL OR IT CAN BE SPAMMED AND RATELIMITED FROM BEING ABUSED***
When you upload the module *my suggestion* is to offsale when uploading so it prevents *pesky hands* from snooping in recently updated and sniping your stuff

### Extra Info

```diff
+ Use the provided lua files in the folder
+ Follow The License
- Use your own webhooks and NOT someone elses please or you'll have problems
```
***IF I FIND OUT THAT YOU USED MY CODE FOR MALICIOUS PURPOSES THEN I WILL TAKE ACTION ON YOUR ACCOUNT IMMEDIATELY***
